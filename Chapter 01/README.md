No program to write for this chapter. 

I used RVM to install ruby 2.1.0, rubygems, and rails on a VM running Ubuntu 13.10 64bit

If you want a good tutorial, Digital Ocean has a pretty good one [here] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin-with-rvm).
